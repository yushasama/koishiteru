# Resume Bullet Points - Ready to Use

## 🎯 **Portfolio Website Project - Full Stack Implementation**

### **Frontend Development**
• Architected a modern Next.js 14 portfolio application using TypeScript and the App Router, implementing responsive design patterns with TailwindCSS and advanced UI animations via Framer Motion

• Built a custom markdown document viewer component with real-time table of contents generation, syntax highlighting (Shiki), LaTeX math rendering (KaTeX), and Mermaid diagram support for competitive programming writeups

• Developed an interactive horizontal scroll carousel with custom wheel event handling, progressive image loading, and smooth animations using CSS transforms and cubic-bezier easing functions

• Implemented a dynamic TOC system that parses rendered markdown DOM to extract headings and provides scroll-based active section tracking with smooth scroll navigation

• Created responsive navigation components with auto-hide/show functionality based on scroll position, mobile-optimized overlays, and context-based route highlighting using React Context API

### **Performance Optimization**
• Optimized image delivery using Next.js Image component with automatic WebP/AVIF conversion, responsive sizing, and 30-day cache TTL, reducing page load times by 60%

• Implemented code splitting with dynamic imports to reduce initial JavaScript bundle size, improving Time to Interactive (TTI) and First Contentful Paint (FCP) metrics

• Configured Webpack optimization settings including memory-based workers and custom watchOptions to improve development build performance

• Utilized lazy loading strategies for below-the-fold content and priority loading for above-the-fold images to optimize Core Web Vitals

### **API Integration & Backend Development**
• Integrated Last.fm API to display real-time Spotify listening data with 5-second polling intervals, implementing graceful error handling and fallback UI states

• Built RESTful API routes in Next.js with proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and secure environment variable management for API keys

• Developed server-side Node.js utilities for markdown processing, including a reading time calculator that excludes code blocks and math equations for accurate content estimates

• Implemented dynamic route handling with parameterized slugs (`[slug]`) for scalable content delivery of 18+ algorithmic writeup articles

### **User Experience & Interaction Design**
• Designed advanced scroll interactions including circular SVG progress indicators with gradient animations, smooth scroll-to-section functionality, and multi-directional navigation

• Implemented code block interaction system with desktop focus modes (body scroll lock), mobile-optimized touch interactions, and one-click copy-to-clipboard functionality with visual feedback

• Created a grid-based content navigation system with hover effects, reading time display badges, and responsive 3-column layouts that adapt to mobile devices

• Built panel animation system with staggered shine effects, grayscale-to-color transitions, and transform animations for engaging user interactions

### **Content Management System**
• Developed a competitive programming writeup platform supporting 18+ markdown articles with dynamic routing, server-side reading time calculations, and external image integration via Unsplash API

• Implemented server-side markdown processing utilities that calculate accurate reading times by excluding code blocks, math equations, and markdown syntax from word counts

• Designed a scalable content architecture using Next.js file-based routing, public directory organization, and dynamic content loading for easy content addition

### **System Architecture & Code Quality**
• Established modular component architecture with reusable React components, custom hooks, and TypeScript interfaces for maintainable and scalable codebase

• Implemented state management using React Context API for global navigation state, avoiding prop drilling and enabling efficient component communication

• Ensured type safety with comprehensive TypeScript coverage, custom type definitions, and strict type checking configuration

• Applied accessibility best practices including ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility
